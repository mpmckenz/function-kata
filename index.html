        <li>Add (1 point) Write a function named "add" that takes two arguments and returns their sum. You may use built-in operators
            to finish the definition. Display the result of calling add(2, 4), which should be 6.</li>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p>
            <i>console.log("Add: 1 Point"); var add = add(2, 4) function add(x, y) { return (x + y) } console.log(add);
            </i>
        </p>
        <li>Multiply (2 points) Write a function named "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product. You may
            not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, you'll need a for loop which calls the "add" function
            you wrote earlier. Display the result of calling multiply(6, 8), which should be 48.</li>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p>
            <i>console.log("Multiply: 2 Points"); function multiply (a, b) { var c = 0 for (let counter = 1; counter
                <=b ; counter++)
                    { c=c+a } return (c) } console.log(multiply(6, 8));</i>
        </p>
        <li>Power (2 points) Write a function named "power" that takes two arguments (x and n) and returns the the result of
            raising x to the nth power. You may not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, use functions
            you wrote in earlier katas to write this function. Display the result of calling power(2, 8), which should be
            256. Another word for this is "exponentiation". In the above example, we arrive at 256 by multiplying 2 by itself
            8 times: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 256 If we had called power(3, 4), we'd want to multiply 3 by itself
            4 times: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 See this (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. Wikipedia article
            for more details on exponentiation.</li>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p>
            <i>console.log("Power: 2 Points"); function Power (a, b) { var c = 1 for (let counter = 1; counter
                <=b ; counter++)
                    { c=c*a } return (c) } console.log(Power(2, 8));</i>
        </p>
        <li>Factorial (2 points) Write a function named "factorial" that takes a single argument and returns the factorial of
            that argument. You may not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, use functions you wrote in
            earlier katas to write this function. Display their result of calling factorial(4), which should be 24 (4 * 3
            * 2 * 1).</li>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p><i>console.log("Factorial: 2 Points");
            function factorialize(counter) {
                let result = counter;
                if(counter===0 || counter===1){
                  return 1;
                }
                while(counter > 1){
                    counter--;
                  result =counter*result;
                }
                return result;
              }
              factorialize(4);
              console.log( factorialize(4));</i></p>
        <li>Fibonacci (3 points) Write a function named "fibonacci" that takes an argument n and returns the nth, Fibonacci number
            (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (click me!). You may not use built-in arithmetic operators
            or functions. Instead, use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function. Display the result of
            calling fibonacci(8), which should be 13: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 [13] 21 The number in brackets is the 8th fibonacci number.</li>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p><i>console.log("Fibonacci: 3 Points");
            function fibonacci(n) {
            var numberbeforeresult = 1;
            var twobeforeresult = 1;
            var result = 0
            for (let counter = 1; counter < n; counter++) {
                twobeforeresult = numberbeforeresult
                numberbeforeresult = result
                result = add(numberbeforeresult, twobeforeresult)
            }
            return result;
        }
            console.log(fibonacci(8));</i></p>
